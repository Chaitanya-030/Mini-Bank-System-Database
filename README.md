# Mini-Bank-System-Database

In this project, we developed a comprehensive database for a mini bank system, featuring the following tables: Account, Customer, AccountCustomer, Branch, Transactions, and DailyBalance. Our approach began with the careful design of the schema, defining the attributes and tables necessary for the system. Following this, we created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to clearly identify all primary and foreign keys.

The primary objective was to present this database to bank managers, who are non-IT professionals, demonstrating how PostgreSQL and pgAdmin can be utilized to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations effectively. To facilitate this, we designed and executed approximately 30-40 queries, showcasing real-life banking scenarios within pgAdmin.

Moreover, we provided training on automating the entire process, from schema creation to executing DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) scripts. This included demonstrating how to run queries via batch files using Python scripts, enabling managers to execute queries without the need to open pgAdmin directly.

This project not only delivered a functional database system but also empowered bank managers with the skills to leverage database technologies for enhanced operational efficiency.
